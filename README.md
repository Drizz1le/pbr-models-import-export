# Pokémon Battle Revolution Model Blender Add-on
A Blender add-on for importing/exporting Pokémon Battle Revolution's models into/from Blender.

## How to use
Download the repository as a ZIP file. In Blender, go to `Edit > Preferences > Add-ons > Install`, then select the ZIP file you downloaded to install the add-on.

### Importing
Navigate to `File > Import > PBR model (.sdr/.odr/.mdr)` and select your `.sdr`, `.odr`, or `.mdr` file.

### Exporting
Assign animations using the PBR tab in the properties panel.
Then, select the armature and go to `File > Export > PBR model (.sdr)`. Make sure only the armature is selected.
#
This addon is targeted at Blender versions `2.93` and above; older versions may not work as intended. To find the models in the ROM you'll need to unpack them from the game's `.fsys` archives.
