# Pokemon Battle Revolution Model Blender Add-on
A Blender add-on for importing/exporting Pokemon Battle Revolution's `.sdr` models into/from Blender.

# How to use
Compress the the contents of this repository into a .zip file and then add that .zip file as an add-on in Blender. 
`Edit > Preferences > Add-ons > Install`

This addon is targeted at Blender versions `2.93` and above; older versions may not work as intended. When the add-on is enabled, navigate to `File > Import > PBR model (.sdr)` and select your `.sdr` model. To find the models in the ROM you'll need to unpack them from the game's `.fsys` archives.
